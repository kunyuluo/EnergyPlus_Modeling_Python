   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=TEST_OFFICE_0_SRF_4
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** Since Zone Minimum Air Flow Input Method = CONSTANT, input for Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate will be ignored.
   **   ~~~   ** Occurs in AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat = VAV HW RHT
   ************* Beginning Plant Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetOAControllerInputs: Controller:MechanicalVentilation="CONTROLLER MECHANICAL VENTILATION 1"
   **   ~~~   ** Cannot locate a matching DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution object for Zone="TEST_OFFICE_0".
   **   ~~~   ** Using default zone air distribution effectiveness of 1.0 for heating and cooling.
   ** Warning ** The design coil load is zero for Coil:Heating:Water COIL HEATING WATER 1
   **   ~~~   ** The autosize value for maximum water flow rate is zero
   **   ~~~   ** To change this, input a value for UA, change the heating design day, or raise the
   **   ~~~   **   system heating design supply air temperature. Also check to make sure the Preheat
   **   ~~~   **   Design Temperature is not the same as the Central Heating Design Supply Air Temperature. 
   ** Warning ** InitController: Controller:WaterCoil="CONTROLLER WATER COIL 1", Maximum Actuated Flow is zero.
   ** Warning ** Missing temperature setpoint for LeavingSetpointModulated mode chiller named CHILLER ELECTRIC EIR 1
   **   ~~~   **   A temperature setpoint is needed at the outlet node of a chiller in variable flow mode, use a SetpointManager
   **   ~~~   **   The overall loop setpoint will be assumed for chiller. The simulation continues ...
