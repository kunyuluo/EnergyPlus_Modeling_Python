   ** Warning ** The design coil load is zero for Coil:Heating:Water AHU HEATING COIL
   **   ~~~   ** The autosize value for maximum water flow rate is zero
   **   ~~~   ** To change this, input a value for UA, change the heating design day, or raise the
   **   ~~~   **   system heating design supply air temperature. Also check to make sure the Preheat
   **   ~~~   **   Design Temperature is not the same as the Central Heating Design Supply Air Temperature. 
   ** Warning ** InitController: Controller:WaterCoil="AHU HEATING COIL CONTROLLER", Maximum Actuated Flow is zero.
   ** Warning ** Missing temperature setpoint for LeavingSetpointModulated mode chiller named CHILLER 1
   **   ~~~   **   A temperature setpoint is needed at the outlet node of a chiller in variable flow mode, use a SetpointManager
   **   ~~~   **   The overall loop setpoint will be assumed for chiller. The simulation continues ...

   ************* There were 2 node connection errors noted.
   **  Fatal  ** Previous Conditions cause program termination.
   ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:
   ..... Reference severe error count=1
   ..... Last severe error=Same component name and type has differing Node Names.
   ************* Warning:  Node connection errors not checked - most system input has not been read (see previous warning).
   ************* Fatal error -- final processing.  Program exited before simulations began.  See previous error messages.
   ** Warning ** There is no BYPASS component in the demand-side of PlantLoop =TEST CHILLED WATER LOOP
   **   ~~~   ** You may be able to fix the fatal error above by adding a demand-side BYPASS PIPE.
   ** Warning ** There is no BYPASS component in the demand-side of PlantLoop =TEST HOT WATER LOOP
   **   ~~~   ** You may be able to fix the fatal error above by adding a demand-side BYPASS PIPE.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Node Connection Errors
   ************* ..Node connection errors are often caused by spelling mistakes in a node name field.
   ************* ..To track down the problem, search the idf file for each node name listed to see if it
   ************* ..occurs in the expected input fields.
   ************* No Reporting Elements requested
   ************* ..No Reporting elements have been requested. You will see no output values from your run.
   ************* ..Add Output:Variable, Output:Meter, Output:Table:SummaryReports, Output:Table:Monthly, Output:Table:TimeBins
   ************* ..objects to your input file to receive output values from the simulation.
