   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=TEST_OFFICE_0_SRF_4
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** Since Zone Minimum Air Flow Input Method = CONSTANT, input for Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate will be ignored.
   **   ~~~   ** Occurs in AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat = TEST_OFFICE_0 TERMINAL
   ** Severe  ** Node TEST_OFFICE_0 TERMINAL INLET connects to no component
   **   ~~~   ** Occurs in Supply Air Path=VAV SYSTEM SUPPLY PATH
   **   ~~~   ** Check the connection to a ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections object
   **   ~~~   ** Check if this component is missing from the Supply Air Path
   ** Severe  ** An outlet node in AirLoopHVAC="VAV SYSTEM" is not connected to any zone
   **   ~~~   ** Could not match ZoneEquipGroup Inlet Node="VAV SYSTEM DEMAND INLET NODE" to any Supply Air Path or controlled zone
   **  Fatal  ** Preceding errors cause termination
   ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:
   ..... Reference severe error count=2
   ..... Last severe error=An outlet node in AirLoopHVAC="VAV SYSTEM" is not connected to any zone
   ************* Warning:  Node connection errors not checked - most system input has not been read (see previous warning).
   ************* Fatal error -- final processing.  Program exited before simulations began.  See previous error messages.
   ************* EnergyPlus Warmup Error Summary. During Warmup: 0 Warning; 0 Severe Errors.
   ************* EnergyPlus Sizing Error Summary. During Sizing: 2 Warning; 2 Severe Errors.
   ************* EnergyPlus Terminated--Fatal Error Detected. 4 Warning; 2 Severe Errors; Elapsed Time=00hr 00min  0.27sec
